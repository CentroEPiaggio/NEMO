%      TOPCOLTURE, by itself, creates a new TOPCOLTURE or raises the existing

%
%      H = TOPCOLTURE returns the handle to a new TOPCOLTURE or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      TOPCOLTURE('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in TOPCOLTURE.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      TOPCOLTURE('Property','Value',...) creates a new TOPCOLTURE or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before TopColture_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to TopColture_OpeningFcn via varargin.
